## Cool Stuff

Interested in the one-offs I'm working on right now? Here are a few:

    AWS is complicated. This site is fun game to help you guess which service is
    AWS and which one is fake.

  PostgreSQL is my favorite database. The website sucks. I'm on a quest to fix it.

## The Robot

In my family, I'm the robot.

I seem to speak a language that nobody else understands: `code`. It looks a little something like this.

```js
/**
 * @returns {Object} An object with all things Aman.
 * @author Aman Meherally
 */
function getAman() {
  return {
    name: "Aman Meherally",
    role: "Full Stack Developer",
    skills: ["Next.js", "TypeScript", "Firebase", "React", "PostgreSQL"],
    mission: "Build beautiful applications using big words",
  };
}
```

Like all good code, I decided I needed documentation. A manual that gives you instructions on how I work.

## Welcome to My Manual

This site is that manual. It’s a transparent look into my architecture, the projects I've shipped, and the core principles I operate by. It's the playbook for how I can contribute to building high-quality, scalable, and delightful products.

<Note>
  This documentation is your guide to understanding my work and how I can help
  you. It’s a living document, so expect updates as I grow and evolve.
