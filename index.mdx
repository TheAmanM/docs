## The Robot

In my family, I'm the robot.

I seem to speak a language that nobody else understands: `code-speak`. It looks a little something like this.

```js
/**
 * @docs Welcome to my personal instruction manual.
 * @description A guide on who I am, what I've worked on,
 * and how I build high-quality products for real consumers.
 * @author Aman Meherally
 */
function getAman() {
  return {
    name: "Aman Meherally",
    role: "Full Stack Developer",
    skills: ["Next.js", "TypeScript", "Firebase", "React", "PostgreSQL"],
    mission: "Build beautiful applications using big words",
  };
}
```

Like all good code, I decided I needed documentation. A manual that gives you instructions on how to interact with me.

## Welcome to My Manual

This site is that manual. It’s a transparent look into my architecture, the projects I've shipped, and the core principles I operate by. It's the playbook for how I can contribute to building high-quality, scalable, and delightful products.

<Note>
  This documentation is your guide to understanding my work and how I can help
  you. It’s a living document, so expect updates as I grow and evolve.
