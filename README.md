_This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, which I treat as documentation about my core operating principles as a developer._

## Inspiration

Writing good code is hard. And when bad code is deployed, the average user bears the concequences.

This portfolio is inspired by the way documentation is written for libraries. It's a manual on my core set of principles, my experiences and projects, and how I can help you write good code.

## Technicals

Stack:

- Mintlify (Next JS under the hood)
- Express ([Source code here](https://github.com/TheAmanM/docs-portfolio-backend))
- TypeScript
